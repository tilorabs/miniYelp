The food was good, but I expected awesome.  The service was terrible.  Our drinks came well after our food arrived.  We ordered rice which came after the meal 
was almost completed.  Our second orders of food never came and our server disappeared for 30 minutes.  While I suspect staffing shortages were apart of the 
challenges, for the price and expectation, I would not recommend this restaurant..', '2022-07-05', 3);

My husband likes Indian food but after Dishoom, he has changed his tune!  Our adult boys were with us, youngest was studying abroad in London & they love it too. 
Our son wished he would have discovered it while he was there, rather than on the last day of our visit to pick him up & bring him home!  Great food,
lots of variety for all tastes.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!', '2022-04-05', 6);

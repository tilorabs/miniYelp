The food was good, but I expected awesome.  The service was terrible.  Our drinks came well after our food arrived.  We ordered rice which came after the meal 
was almost completed.  Our second orders of food never came and our server disappeared for 30 minutes.  While I suspect staffing shortages were apart of the 
challenges, for the price and expectation, I would not recommend this restaurant..',

My husband likes Indian food but after Dishoom, he has changed his tune!  Our adult boys were with us, youngest was studying abroad in London & they love it too. 
Our son wished he would have discovered it while he was there, rather than on the last day of our visit to pick him up & bring him home!  Great food,
lots of variety for all tastes.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!', '2022-04-05', 6);

We ordered samosas for appetizers, sag paneer, chicken tika masala, butter chicken, and acharri murgha. The food itself was bland and underwhelming. Not seasoned enough, sauce and meat included. If you are looking for a lot of flavor and authenticity, this aint it.

Not very attentive service, server seemed annoyed after couple questions about the menu from us.

One positive star is their interior design is quite nice.',

When I finally got to visit post-Covid in January, I went to their SoHo location and got to try their fried chicken and confit baos which I both loved! These are textbook amazing baos that are of quality and surprisingly filling for what it is. The bun of the fried chicken one is also somewhat made with sesame which I liked. I got one of their alcoholic spritz which complemented my order well.',
